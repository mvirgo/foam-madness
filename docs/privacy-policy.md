## Privacy Policy

Foam Madness does not collect personal information of any kind.

The only data related to your app is stored on-device, and is only related to
any tournaments and games you create and play.

### What is Personal Information?

Personal information noted here relates to data such as email addresses, first
and last name, phone number, address, social media information, location,
contacts, audio, pictures or other identifiers that is capable of being
associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with
a particular consumer or household. As noted above, none of this information
is collected by the app, directly or indirectly.

### Marketing, Advertising and Analytics

No personal information is used for marketing, advertising or analytics purposes
by the app. No third parties have access to your information through the app.

### Selling/Distribution of Your Data

Your personal information (which, again, is not collected) is not
sold or otherwise distributed.

### Government Requests for Data

There is no personal information to give for any government requests for user
data, so it's unlikely for Foam Madness to receive one, but I would comply
if legally required.

### Deleting Your User Data

As noted above, no personal information is collected by the app. However,
if you otherwise want to get rid of app-related information like your games and
tournaments, you can delete the app from your phone (and re-install if you
still want to play).

### Exceptions to the Policy

There are no exceptions to the above stated policy.
